# face-detection
Face detection can be achieved by utilizing the Haar cascade classifier algorithm. 
This algorithm is commonly used in computer vision for detecting objects in images or video streams. 
It works by identifying patterns of pixel intensities that are characteristic of the object being detected, 
in this case, faces. The Haar cascade classifier breaks down the detection process into multiple stages, 
with each stage using a different Haar-like feature to determine if the object is present.
This allows for efficient and accurate detection of faces of human  in various settings and orientations.
